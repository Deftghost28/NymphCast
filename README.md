# NymphCast #

NymphCast is a software solution which turns your choice of Linux-capable hardware into an audio and video source for a television or powered speakers. It enables the streaming of audio and video over the network from a wide range of client devices, as well as the streaming of internet media to a NymphCast server, controlled by a client device.

In addition, it supports powerful apps (NymphCast apps) written in AngelScript to extend the functionality of NymphCast with a variety of online services. 

The main NymphCast website [can be found here](http://nyanko.ws/product_nymphcast.php "NymphCast site") at the Nyanko.ws website.

## Releases ##

NymphCast is currently in Alpha stage, with experimental releases being made available on Github (see the '[releases](https://github.com/MayaPosch/NymphCast/releases "Releases")' section).

For **pacman** based distros (ArchLinux, Manjaro), some packages exist for:

* the server: [nymphcast-server-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nymphcast-server-git/)
* the sdk: [nymphcast-sdk-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nymphcast-sdk-git/)
* the player: [nymphcast-player-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nymphcast-player-git/)

For Alpine Linux and postmarketOS, packages are available in the **testing** repository:

* the server: [nymphcast-server](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/testing/x86_64/nymphcast-server)
* the sdk: [nymphcast-dev](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/testing/x86_64/nymphcast-dev)
* the player: [nymphcast-client](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/testing/x86_64/nymphcast-client)

## Goals ##

- [x] Server (receiver) works on mainstream Linux-capable Single-Board Computers (SBCs), tested on Raspberry Pi 2 (v1.1) and Raspberry Pi Zero (W).

- [x] Streaming of local media to a NymphCast server.

- [x] Sending of URLs, for streaming by the server without client interaction.

- [x] Sending of commands, to control volume, open and control NymphCast apps.

## Project layout ##

The layout of relevant folders in the project is as follows:

	/
	|- player 	(the NymphCast demonstration client)
	|- src/
	|	|- client 		(basic NymphCast client, for testing)
	|	|- client_lib 	(NymphCast SDK files)
	|	|- server		(the NymphCast server and NymphCast app files)
	|- tools	(shell scripts for creating releases, in progress)


## Player ##

The NymphCast Player is provided as a demonstration of the NymphCast SDK (see details on the SDK later in the document), allowing one to make use of the basic NymphCast functionality. It is designed to run on any mainstream desktop OS, as well as Android-based smartphones and tablets.

An APK has been made available for installation on Android in the 'releases' section. A desktop release for Windows (x64) is available as well.

## Getting Started ##

**Note:** This section is for building the project from source. Look under the 'Releases' section for binary builds.

This getting started guide assumes building the receiver (**server**) project on a system (like a Raspberry Pi) running a current version of Debian (Buster) or equivalent. The **player** application can be built on Linux/BSD/MacOS with a current GCC toolchain, or MSYS2 on Windows with MinGW toolchain. 

**Server**

After cloning the project to one's system, two options are possible:

1. Run the `setup.sh` script in the project root to perform the below tasks automatically.
2. Run the `install_linux.sh` script in the project root to install Avahi & Systemd services on Linux systems which support both.

Or:

1. Follow the instructions in the 'Building' section.

**Player**

For Windows (x64):

1. Download and extract the binary release.

Or (Windows & other platforms):

1. Build the libnymphcast library in the `src/client_lib` folder using the Makefile in that folder: `make lib`.
2. Install the newly created library under `lib/` into `/usr/local/lib` or equivalent.
3. Copy the `nymphcast_client.h` header to `/usr/local/include` or equivalent.
4. Ensure the Qt5 dependency is installed.
5. Create `player/NymphCastPlayer/build` folder and change into it.
6. Execute `qmake ..` followed by `make`.
7. Binary is created either in the same build folder or in a `debug/` sub-folder.
8. Execute the binary to open the player.
9. Connect to the server instance using its IP address.
10. Cast a media file or URL.

## Platforms ##

The server targets SBCs, but like the client (and SDK) should work on any platform that supports a C++17 toolchain and is supported by the LibPoco dependency:

* Windows XP+ 
* MacOS
* Linux (desktop & embedded)
* Solaris
* *BSD
* HP-UX
* AIX
* QNX
* VxWorks
* Android
* iOS
* Windows Embedded

The server relies on the FFmpeg library, which is supported on a wide variety of platforms, with Linux, MacOS and Windows being the primary platforms.


## Building ##

To build NymphCast, one needs the following dependencies in addition to a C++ toolchain with C++17 support.

Run the Makefile in the `client` and `server` folders, which should output a binary into the newly created `bin/` folder.


**Server:**

Dependencies:

* [NymphRPC](https://github.com/MayaPosch/NymphRPC)
* [LibAV](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Using%20libav*) (v4+) 
* LibSDL2
* LibPOCO (1.5+)

On Debian & derivatives:

1. Install the needed dependencies: `sudo apt -y install libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-dev libpoco-dev` and `sudo apt -y install libswscale-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libpostproc-dev libswresample-dev`
2. Check-out [NymphRPC](https://github.com/MayaPosch/NymphRPC) elsewhere and build the library with `make lib`.
3. Copy the NymphRPC library from `NymphRPC/lib/` to `/usr/local/lib` (or on Linux: shared library to `usr/lib`).
4. Create `/usr/local/include/nymph` folder. Perform `sudo cp src/*.h /usr/local/include/nymph`.
5. Change to `NymphCast/src/server` and execute `make` command.
6. The server binary is found under `bin/`. Copy the *.jpg images into a `bin/wallpapers/` folder for the screensaver feature.
7. Copy the `nymphcast_config.ini` file into `bin/` as well.
8. Copy the `apps/` folder into the `bin/`' folder.
9. Execute the binary from the `bin/` folder to have it start listening on port 4004: `./nymphcast_server -c nymphcast_config.ini`.

### Client dependencies ###

* [NymphRPC](https://github.com/MayaPosch/NymphRPC)
* LibPOCO (1.5+)


## Running ##

The **server binary** can be started with just a configuration file, and will listen on all network interfaces for incoming connections. It supports the following options:

* `-h`	`--help`			Get this help message.
* `-c`	`--configuration`	Path to the configuration file.
* `-a`	`--apps`			Path to the NymphCast apps folder.
* `-w`	`--wallpaper`		Path to the wallpapers folder.

The **client binary** has to be provided with the filename of a media file that should be sent to the remote server, with an optional IP address of the remote server:

	$ nymphcast_client <filename>
	$ nymphcast_client <IP> <filename>

The **NymphCast Player** is a GUI-based application and accepts no command line options.

## Limitations ##

* The server is assumed to have 100 MB heap space free for caching.

## SDK ##

An SDK has been made available in the `src/client_lib/` folder. The player project under `player/` uses the SDK as part of a Qt5 project to implement a NymphCast client which exposes all of the NymphCast features to the user.

To use the SDK, the Makefile in the SDK folder can be executed with a simple `make` command, after which a library file can be found in the `src/client_lib/lib` folder. 

**Note:** to compile the SDK, both [NymphRPC](https://github.com/MayaPosch/NymphRPC) and LibPOCO (1.5+) must be installed.

After this the only files needed by a client project are this library file and the `nymphcast_client.h` header file.
